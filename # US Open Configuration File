2. Broken-down Tasks: Break down big processes and tasks into smaller, more achievable steps.
3.Gradual Withdrawal: Remember and recognize what the user has been able to accomplish, so that the next steps in a task are given with gradually fewer hints and scaffolds.
4. Keep Track and Reflect: Keep track of the user’s progress, periodically reminding them of where they are in the process. Prompts the user to reflect upon their progress upon completion of the task.
